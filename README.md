# Bike Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data to uncover trends and provide actionable insights for better decision-making. Using Excel, I performed data cleaning, organized and summarized the data with pivot tables, created visual charts, and developed an interactive dashboard with filters for dynamic data exploration.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed any inconsistencies, duplicates, and null values from the dataset.
   - Standardized data formats to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

2. **Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables**  
   - Created pivot tables to summarize:
     - Average income of customers.
     - Count of bike purchases segmented by different demographics.
   - Segmented data based on marital status, region, and education level to explore deeper insights.

3. **Data Visualization with Charts**  
   - Created various charts, including bar charts and pie charts, to visualize trends in bike purchases.
   - Focused on key metrics, such as income distribution, purchase trends by region, and purchase behavior by marital status.

4. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   - Developed an Excel dashboard featuring interactive filters:
     - Users can filter data by marital status, region, and education level to view specific insights.
   - Integrated charts and summaries for a visually engaging and user-friendly experience.

## Insights & Findings
- The analysis provided insights into which demographic factors impact bike purchase behavior.
- Average income and education level were observed to be influential factors in customer purchasing decisions.
- The dashboard serves as a quick-reference tool for key insights and data-driven decision-making.
